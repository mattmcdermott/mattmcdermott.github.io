I'm a fifth-year PhD candidate in Materials Science & Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. I am originally from Austin, TX, where I attended the University of Texas, at Austin and graduated with a B.S. Mechanical Engineering (w/ Highest Honors).

I work in [Prof. Kristin Persson's research group](https://perssongroup.lbl.gov/) at Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley, CA). My research focuses on developing predictive materials
synthesis and is funded through the Department of Energy's [GENESIS Energy Frontier
Research Center (EFRC)](https://www.stonybrook.edu/genesis/).

You can catch me playing drums in a Berkeley-based indie rock band
called [Casachanclas](https://casachanclas.bandcamp.com/). I also love to hike; I
recently completed all 211+ miles of the John Muir Trail in 2022 (see future
blog post for more!).

Feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn if you'd like to chat!
