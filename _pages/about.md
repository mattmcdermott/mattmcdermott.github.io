I'm a fourth-year PhD candidate in Materials Science & Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. I am originally from Austin, TX, where I attended the University of Texas, at Austin and graduated with a B.S. Mechanical Engineering (w/ Highest Honors).

I work in [Prof. Kristin Persson's research group]((perssongroup.lbl.gov)) at Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley, CA). My research focuses on developing predictive materials
synthesis and is funded through the Department of Energy's [GENESIS Energy Frontier
Research Center (EFRC)](https://www.stonybrook.edu/genesis/).
