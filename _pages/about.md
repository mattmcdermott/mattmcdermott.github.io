I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory working
in Kristin Persson's research group. I received my PhD in Materials Science &
Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley (May 2023). I am originally from
Austin, TX, where I attended the University of Texas, at Austin and graduated with a B.S.
Mechanical Engineering (w/Highest Honors).

I research and develop algorithms for predicting and optimizing synthesis of inorganic
materials. I am particularly interested in accelerating the synthesis of novel materials
and making conventional materials synthesis recipes more efficient (quicker, cheaper, etc.).

You can catch me playing drums in a Berkeley-based indie rock band
called [Casachanclas](https://casachanclas.bandcamp.com/). I also love to hike; I
recently completed all 211+ miles of the John Muir Trail in August 2022 (see my blog for
more info).
