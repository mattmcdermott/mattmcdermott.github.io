If you're reading this, you've somehow found your way to my personal blog. **Welcome**! 

I plan to use this page as an outlet to write about things that interest me -- materials
science, chemistry, data science, music, and more. 

This blog journey will begin with some helpful posts about tricky concepts I've
learned as I've gone through my PhD in computational materials science. I hope to cover
such things as phase diagrams, chemical potential diagrams, reaction networks, and more.
